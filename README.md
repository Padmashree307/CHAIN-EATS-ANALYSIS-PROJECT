# ChainEats Analytics: Restaurant Chain Performance Optimization

A comprehensive data analytics project delivering **$800K in projected annual improvements** through data-driven insights.

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

ChainEats, a 50-location restaurant chain, needed data-driven strategies to optimize underperforming locations and improve overall profitability. This analysis identified **$800K in annual improvement potential** across rent, menu, and operations.

### **Key Results**
- **78%** of locations are profitable with optimization potential
- **$180K** annual savings from rent optimization alone
- **25%** revenue variation driven by weather patterns
- **8-12%** margin improvement possible through menu optimization
- **15%** cost reduction achievable via weather-based operations

---

## 💼 Business Problem

**Challenge:**  
- Inconsistent performance across 50 locations in 5 cities
- Unknown factors driving profitability differences
- Need for data-driven expansion and optimization strategies
- Lack of operational insights for cost reduction

**Solution:**  
Comprehensive analytics covering location performance, menu optimization, seasonal patterns, and weather impact analysis.

## 📈 Key Business Insights

### Top Performers
- **Best Cities:** Miami leads with $47K average profit per location
- **Optimal Location Types:** Airport locations generate $2,400 daily profit average
- **Peak Season:** Summer shows 20% higher revenue than baseline

### Improvement Opportunities
- High Rent Burden: 8 locations spending >15% revenue on rent
- Underperformers: 11 locations below benchmark requiring intervention
- Menu Optimization: 3 categories need pricing or positioning changes

### Weather Intelligence
- Revenue Impact: 25% swing between optimal and poor weather conditions
- Operational Insight: Mild temperatures + clear skies = peak performance days

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (30 Days)**
- Rent Renegotiation: Target $180K annual savings from high-burden locations
- Menu Optimization: Focus marketing on high-margin, high-volume categories
- Underperformer Intervention: Implement improvement plans for below-benchmark locations

### **Strategic Implementation (6 Months)**
- Weather-Based Operations: Dynamic staffing and inventory based on forecasts
- Location Portfolio Optimization: Close 3–4 consistently unprofitable locations
- Expansion Strategy: Prioritize airport and mall locations in high-growth cities

**Expected Impact:**  
**$800K Annual Improvement** (229% ROI)
